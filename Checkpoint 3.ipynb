    "\n",
    "This problem concerns obtaining the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrum of water from a raw NMR signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given: a file containing the free-induction decay signal $y(t)$ (electromagnetic radiation emitted by protons in water), following an RF $\\pi$-pulse of f=60MHz. The recorded signal is frequency-subtracted, i.e., the radio-frequency output signal has been mixed with the carrier frequency f=60MHz to shift the signal to lower frequencies in the range of hundreds of Hz.\n",
    "\n",
    "The signal has three main components: the actual NMR signal from protons in water molecules, white noise, and a 50 Hz \"mains hum\" (electrical signal picked up by the sensitive NMR detector, coming from the mains AC; the signal also contains higher harmonics).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hints on how to solve this checkpoint:\n",
    "- The code must work (and will be tested on) for other data files, in which the frequency of the water peak may differ by 10%. Any 'fine-tuning' of your algorithms so that they only work for the given data file is therefore discouraged.\n",
    "- Write the code in a modular way so that you can re-use functions from previous tasks. This will save you a lot of time.\n",
    "- Do not make the code more complex that it needs to be. Classes, complex data structures etc. are not required for this checkpoint.\n",
    "- Use NumPy/SciPy functions rather than your own implementation whenever possible.\n",
    "- As in CP1 and CP2, apart from numerical accuracy, efficiency and coding style will also be marked. Try to make your code readable.\n",
    "- Comment on the results obtained. This may help to get a better mark if there is a problem with the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**There are 6 tasks in this CP worth 100 points, plus a bonus task 7 worth 15 points. The total mark will be the sum of all marks, or 100 points, whichever is lower.**"
